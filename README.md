An MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for an Augmented Reality AI Companion designed to [describe its core purpose in one or two sentences, e.g., provide interactive assistance, offer companionship through AR, etc.].

## Description

This project aims to explore the intersection of Augmented Reality and Artificial Intelligence to create an interactive companion.
Explain in more detail:
*   What kind of AI companion is it (e.g., informational, conversational, task-oriented)?
*   What problem does it solve or what user need does it address?
*   What are the key interactions or experiences it offers?
*   What is the motivation behind this project and its future vision?

For example:
*This AR AI Companion (MVP0) is a proof-of-concept demonstrating how an AI entity can be visualized and interact within a user's real-world environment using AR. It leverages [mention key AI technology, e.g., natural language processing] to understand and respond to user queries and [mention key AR technology, e.g., image tracking] to anchor itself in the physical space.*

## Features

List the key features of your AR AI Companion. Be specific and highlight what makes it unique or useful.

*   **AR Visualization:** How is the AI companion represented in AR? (e.g., 3D model, abstract form)
*   **AI Interaction:** How does the user interact with the AI? (e.g., voice commands, text input, gestures)
*   **Contextual Awareness (if applicable):** Does the companion react to the real-world environment?
*   **[Specific Feature 1]:** e.g., Real-time object recognition and information overlay.
*   **[Specific Feature 2]:** e.g., Conversational AI with personalized responses.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

List any software, tools, or libraries that users need to have installed before they can install and run your project. Include specific versions if necessary.

* Node.js (e.g., v14.x or later)
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
* Python (e.g., v3.8 or later)
  ```sh
  # Instructions for installing Python if needed
  ```
* [Name of another prerequisite] (e.g., specific version)

### Installation

Provide a step-by-step guide on how to install your project.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/skyblue030/mvp0_ar_ai_companion.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd your_project_name
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    *   If it's a Node.js project:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
    *   If it's a Python project (with a `requirements.txt` file):
        ```sh
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
4.  **Set up environment variables (if applicable):**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the `.env.example` file (if you provide one).
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then, update the `.env` file with your specific configurations:
    ```env
    API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
    DATABASE_URL=YOUR_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING
    SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
    ```
5.  **Run database migrations (if applicable):**
    ```sh
    # Example: npm run migrate or python manage.py migrate
    ```
6.  **Start the application:**
    *   For a Node.js application:
        ```sh
        npm start
        ```
    *   For a Python/Flask/Django application:
        ```sh
        python app.py
        # or
        # flask run
        # or
        # python manage.py runserver
        ```

## Usage

Explain how to use your project after installation. Provide examples, code snippets, screenshots, or GIFs to make it clear.

**Example 1: Running a specific command**
```sh
your_program --input data.csv --output results.json --verbose
```

**Example 2: Using a function from the library (if it's a library)**
```python
# main.py
from your_project_module import cool_function

result = cool_function(parameter1="value1", parameter2="value2")
print(f"The result is: {result}")
```
